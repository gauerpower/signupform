# signupform
Basic signup form using MailChimp API. Node/Express/Bootstrap.

Note that this will not work as-is because the API key and audience ID are in a .env that has been gitignore'd. If you want to view the completed/deployed version, visit https://immense-tundra-35132.herokuapp.com/ - it should send you a confirmation email if you type your info in. (I don't plan on using this email list for anything, so don't worry about spam.)
